## Features

- Automatic identification of region of interest(ROI)
- Extract ROI
- Digitise handwritten text
- Store results in a CSV file


## Documentation

Handwritten documents must be digitised to improve storage, access, search, and analysis. Prior to the deep learning revolution, there was no clear path to achieve such a goal in a scalable manner.

Because of the variability of handwriting, automatic text detection and segmentation can be error-proneÂ and frequently require custom preprocessing.
